# Fish Animation Website

This is a simple website that features an animated fish swimming in the background.

## Project Structure
The JavaScript dependencies are structured as follows:

```
vector.js
    ↓
bodypart.js
    ↓
body.js
    ↓
fish.js
    ↓
draw.js
    ↓
main.js
```

## Development
The project uses vanilla JavaScript with no external dependencies. Each file has a specific responsibility:
- `vector.js`: Handles vector calculations
- `bodypart.js`: Manages individual body parts
- `body.js`: Controls the fish body structure
- `fish.js`: Implements fish behavior
- `draw.js`: Handles rendering
- `main.js`: Main application logic
